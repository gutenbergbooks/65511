When the warm rains
succeed winter’s driving
downpours, and the
young grass begins to
mantle the meadows&nbsp;<img src='images/i_009a.jpg' alt='' class='img' />
with tender green, is
the time, of all the year,
to be out of doors&nbsp;<img src='images/i_009b.jpg' alt='' class='img' />
All the woodsy places are cool and dripping
and dim and delicious. A month later they
will be not less beautiful, perhaps, but less
approachable. The things of Nature grow sophisticated
as the season advances. In the
early springtime they are frank and confiding,
and willingly tell the secrets of their growth
to him who asks&nbsp;<img src='images/i_009c.jpg' alt='' class='img' /> They have time, in these
first beginnings of things, for friendly sociability:
to show their tiny roots and bulbs,
and let us study the delicate, gracious unfoldings
of leaf and bud and blossom. In a few
weeks they will all be too busy, keeping up
with the season’s swift march, to stop and
visit with the lovingest of human friends.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Do we forget, from springtime to springtime,
how lovely will be the year’s awakening?
Each winter of our discontent I think that I
remember, as my longing imagination looks
forward, the tender charm of the springtime
wonder, yet with each recurring year it comes
to me as a new and unknown joy&nbsp;<img src='images/i_009d.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>The whole world seems to welcome the new
year-child. Even before the first growths appear
there is a hushed awareness throughout
Nature that moves the heart to thankfulness
and remembered expectation&nbsp;<img src='images/i_010a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /> The hope of
springtime comes without stint, and without
fail, bringing each one of us the message his
heart is prepared to receive, and quickening
our purest, least sordid impulses. The best
that is in us seems possible, in the springtime.
Who of us does not then dream that
this best will yet gain strength to withstand
the heat and drouth of summer’s fierce searching?
We turn to Mother Nature like children
who long to be good. The worshipping instinct
that lies deep within each soul goes
out to her, vesting her in that personality
which we have long since pronounced unthinkable
when applied to God. There is a
suggestion in the situation that is not without
a certain saving humor to relieve it from
grotesqueness. We are not far from a personal
god when we send our souls out in loving
contemplation of personified Nature, yet
we still go on asking if God is, and if He is
Truth. Whom do we ask, and why does the
question rise? If God is Truth, He must be
universal; and to be perceived by each soul
for himself&nbsp;<img src='images/i_010b.jpg' alt='' class='img' /> If, then, I perceive him not,
either He is not the truth or else I am simple
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>and sincere in desiring the truth. If He is not
the truth, do I then desire human persuasion
that He is? Or, if I am not simple and sincere,
who can make me so?</p>

Nature will help us if we turn to
her. We have filled our lives so
full of complexities and problems
that it is well for us to have her
annual reminder that even without our taking
thought about it the real world, that will be
here when we, with all our busyness, shall
have passed from sight, has renewed itself,
and stands bidding us come and find peace.</p>

<p class='c000'>For Nature keeps open house for us, and even
when we visit her and leave a trail of dust
and desolation behind us, like the stupid, untidy
children we are, she only sets herself,
with the silent, persistent patience of her
age-wise motherhood, to cover and remove
it. Down in the canyon, this morning, among
the trillium and loosestrife and wild potato,
I found the inevitable tin can left by some
picnicker to mar and desecrate the landscape,
but now completely filled with soft
brown mold, and growing in it a mass of
happy green wood-sorrel&nbsp;<img src='images/i_011a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>This is better than going at things with a
broom, gathering them up and removing them
from one place to another, which is about as
far as we humans have progressed in our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>science of cleaning up&nbsp;<img src='images/i_012a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /> I was glad to welcome
the trillium. How one loves its quaint
old name of wake-robin, fitting title for this
first harbinger of spring, that comes to us
even before the robin’s note is heard. Many
of our common wild-flowers have several
names, but there is none with such invariably
pretty ones as all ages have united in
bestowing upon wake-robin. Birth-root, our
forefathers called it, seeing the birth of the
new year in its early blossoming, and
how many generations have known
it as the trinity-flower! But ’tis
best known, I think, as wake-robin,
and the very
breath of spring is
in the name.</p>

  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_013.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
A member of the great lily family
is wake-robin&nbsp;<img src='images/i_013a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /> It loves damp,
shady places and moist, rich valleys.
On the Pacific Coast we do
not find the typical Eastern variety, but we
have a variety of our own, tho’ unmistakably
wake-robin. Its color varies from rich madder-red
to pale-pink, sometimes almost white. It
grows from a thick, tuber-like root, and the
calyx has, surrounding its three red petals
and three green sepals, three broad, mottled-green
leaves which, for some unaccountable
reason, our florists remove when they offer
the flower for sale. A strange whimsy, this.
The poor blossoms, thus denuded, have a bewildered,
self-conscious air, such as may
have been worn by the little egg-selling woman
of old, who awoke from her nap by the
king’s highway to find her petticoats shorn.
Well may wake-robin thus question its own
identity. It is no longer the trillium of the
forest: it is only the trillium of commerce, a
sad, unlovely object&nbsp;<img src='images/i_013b.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<div  class='figright id005'>
<img src='images/i_013-w.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>A bank where wake-robin lifts its bonny head
is always fair to see. The plant has certain
boon companions always sure to be close at
hand. The Solomon’s seal is one of these, its
roots bearing to this day the round marks imagined
by the early foresters to be none other
than the seal of Solomon, the son of David,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>(on both of whom be peace!)&nbsp;<img src='images/i_014a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /> There is
no more exquisite green than the beautiful,
shining leaves of this plant, with its tiny
white bells of flowers. It has a near relative
almost always growing near it, that, with
singular paucity of imagination, our botanists
have called “False Solomon’s Seal.”</p>

<div class='section'>

</div>

<div class='c006'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_014.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Now we reveal our mental habits
through this trick we have of falsifying
plants. We say “false”
asphodel, “false” rice, “false”
hellebore, “false” spikenard and mitrewort,
but the falsity is in our own vain imaginings.
The plants are as true as the earth that bears
them, or the rain and the sunshine that bring
them to perfection. The Solomon’s seal is
one lily, the “false” Solomon’s seal another.
Man may be false, “perilous Godheads of
choosing” are his, but the wild things of the
woods are true, each in the order of its nature
<img src='images/i_014b.jpg' alt='' class='img' /> There are no complexities or subtilities
about wake-robin, here by the streamside.
You may see it at a glance, for its principles
are brief and fundamental, as wise old
Marcus Aurelius bids us let our own be, and
yet, the plant has had its vicissitudes; has
met and solved its problems. Reasoning from
analogies, time must have been when, like
others of its great family, it grew in the
water, floating out its broad leaves, lolling at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>ease on the surface of swampy, watery places
and still ponds. Times changed. Lands rose
and waters subsided, and wake-robin found
itself in the midst of new conditions. The
problem of self-support confronted it, and the
plant solved it by divesting from its broad,
sustaining sepals nutriment to enable the
long, swaying stem to meet the new demands
upon it. It still loves water and seeks cool,
damp woods and deep canyons, growing beside
little streams where it lifts its face to
greet the springtime. It is probably not so big
as when it rested luxuriously upon the water,
but it is wake-robin, still, and it does more
than summon the birds: it calls each of
us back to Nature, bidding us keep
our hearts and souls alive to see,
with each renewing of springtime,
and to love afresh,
the miracles of Nature’s
redemptive
force.</p>

The beauty of springtime,
like the beauty of childhood,
is always new. All
about me the things of Nature
are still in the mystical,
subtile tenderness of
their young, green growth.
The golden days of autumn
are full of their own beauty.
The grey days of winter’s
mist and fog have theirs,
but there is something in
the tender blue days of the
rainy springtime that sets
the heart apraise, and&nbsp;<img src='images/i_016a.jpg' alt='' class='img' />
brings out as nothing else
can, the meanings of leaf
and bud, of flower and tree.
It is raining, now. Up above
me, on the road, several
picnickers who have been
caught in this April shower
are hurrying to shelter&nbsp;<img src='images/i_016b.jpg' alt='' class='img' />
They look down curiously
at me, here under the willow,
and I have some misgiving
as to whether they
are not setting an example
that I should follow&nbsp;<img src='images/i_016c.jpg' alt='' class='img' />
But I am sure that it is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>great mistake always to know enough to go
in when it rains. One may keep snug and dry
by such knowledge, but one misses a world
of loveliness. There is, after all, a certain selective
wisdom that sees the desirability of
taking the showers as they come.</p>

<div class='section'>

<div class='c006'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_017.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
There is something peculiarly
tender and loving about an
April shower. One is so fully
conscious, even while the drops
are falling, that the sun is shining
behind the light clouds.
And the drops themselves come down so
gently, tentatively offering themselves, as it
were, to the welcoming earth—pattering lightly
on the leaves, and softly rippling the surface
of the little pool under the willows. That
is a wonderful sort of comparison the Hebrew
poet gives us when he likens the teaching of
truth to the small rain upon the tender herb:
the showers upon the green grass&nbsp;<img src='images/i_017a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>The young colt in the stall, yonder, thrusts
an eager head over the half-door, and with
soft black muzzle in the air, stands with open
mouth to catch the delicious trickle. The
cattle on the hills seem glad of the wetting.
Even the birds have not sought shelter, and
why should I?&nbsp;<img src='images/i_017b.jpg' alt='' class='img' /> I love to watch the leaves of
the trees and plants, in the rain. They tell us
so many secrets about the life of which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>are a part. Why, for instance, does this pond
lily spread out its broad, pleasant leaves upon
the water’s surface, while its cousin the
brodeia has long, narrow, grass-like leaves?
Why do the leaves of the pungent wormwood,
here, stand rigidly pointing upwards,
while those of this big oak are spread out before
the descending rain?</p>

  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_018.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Watch the wormwood. See how
the raindrops quiver for an instant
on the tips of the pinnate
leaves, then follow one another
in a mad chase down the groove that traverses
the center of each leaf. Notice that the
leaf itself rises from three ridges on the stem
of the plant, and that between these ridges
lie shallow grooves down which the raindrops
run to the plant’s root. Now, we can
tell from these signs what sort of a root the
wormwood has. I never pulled one of the
plants, but I am sure that if we were to do so
we should find it to have a main tap-root,
with no branches. All such plants have leaves
pointing upwards, and grooved stems, admirably
adapted to bring water to the thirsty
roots. The beets and the radishes afford us
capital examples of this provision&nbsp;<img src='images/i_018a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>This alfileria has another arrangement of leaf,
for this same purpose. It is a widely spreading
forage-plant, with an absurdly small root.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>It needs a great deal of moisture, and so its
stems are thickly set with soft, fuzzy hairs,
that catch the water and convey it to the
root&nbsp;<img src='images/i_019a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /> Growing all along the bank is the
little chickweed, with its tiny white star of a
blossom. If it were not so common we should
wax enthusiastic over its beauty, and seek it
for our garden borders. It has a running,
thread-like root, which receives the
raindrops caught by the stem in
a single row of tiny hairs
along its lower side,
and sprinkled gently
down.</p>

When a plant has a spreading root
such as the willow, yonder, sends
down, the leaves spread outward
and downward, from base to tip,
letting their gathered moisture down upon
it. When the plant grows under water its
leaves are long and thread-like; for the supply
of carbon is limited, and they divide minutely,
that the greatest possible surface may
be exposed to absorb it. If the stem grows
until the leaves reach the surface of the
water they broaden and spread out, for here
they get an abundant food supply which they
may freely appropriate, as none of it need be
diverted to build up a supporting stem. The
water affords the leaves ample support&nbsp;<img src='images/i_020a.jpg' alt='' class='img' />
The grasses grow in blades for the same reason
that the plants growing under water put
out slender, thread-like leaves. The air-supply
would seem abundant, but the grass-leaves
are many, and low-growing plants are numerous.
So they divide and sub-divide, that
greater surface may be presented to the sunlight
and the air. In this form the blades are
fittest to obtain their necessary food supply
and thus to survive. We see this same tendency
in the leaves of the wild poppy, the
buttercup and all the great crowfoot family.
Across the road stretches a line of locusts,
just now in dainty, snowy, fragrant blossom.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>The individuality of a tree is a constant and
delightful fact in Nature. The locust is as unlike
the oak or the willow as can well be imagined,
yet like them in taking on an added
and characteristic loveliness in the rain. How
delicately the branches pencil themselves
against the blue and silver of the cloudy sky
and the dark green of the orchard beyond
them! The leaves have such a purely incidental
air. The lines of the tree were, themselves,
lovely enough in their green and mossy
wetness, to delight the eye. To deck them so
laceywise in an openwork of leaf and blossom
was beneficent gratuity on the part of
Mother Nature, for the pleasing of her children.</p>

Down below, where the creek widens,
the sycamores have grown to
great size. How they help the heart,
these gnarly giants, with the white
patches against the greys and blacks of their
rough trunks!&nbsp;<img src='images/i_021a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /> How they spread their

<p class='c000'>Over the rounded hill, stealing softly, in Indian
file, through the mist, a row of eucalyptus
trees climb, fringing up the slopes. These
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>ladies of the hilltop have a fashion of growing
thus, and in no other position is their delicate,
suggestive beauty more apparent. The eucalyptus
is an original genius among trees, never
repeating itself. It stands for endless variety,
for strong good cheer, for faith that seeks and
reaches and goes on, never wavering&nbsp;<img src='images/i_022a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /> It
blesses as well as delights its friends. I love
its wonderful, ever varying leaves, its up-reaching,
outstretching branches, and the annual
surprise of its mystic blossoming. Each
tree is distinct and individual in its growth,
yet every one is typical of the genus.</p>

It is a tree of the wind and the storm.
See how those in yonder group sway
and courtesy, bow and beckon, advance
and retreat in the light breeze! And the
rain does such marvels to them in the
way of color, tinting the leaves into
wondrous things of glistening black-and-silver,
and bringing out exquisite, evasive greens
and browns, red and rose colors, tender blues
and greys, from the trunks and branches&nbsp;<img src='images/i_022b.jpg' alt='' class='img' />

<p class='c000'>Yes, I am sure that there is a wisdom wiser
than the prudence which sends us in out of
the rain. The flowers and the grasses teach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>us more than has ever been put between the
covers of books. The trees bring us the real
news of the real world long before they are
crushed into pulp and made into the paper
on which is printed our morning service from
the scandal monger and the stock broker. It
was heralded as a marvelous triumph of modern
ingenuity when, the other day, a forest
tree was cut down and made into paper on
which the news of the world was printed and
hawked along the streets within four and one-half
hours from the moment when the axe
was laid at the root of the tree. Marvelously
clever, that, but shall we ever be wise enough
to bring the trees themselves to the city, instead?
If we were but able to read the message
they bear, the newspaper might go away
into outer darkness, whence it sprang.</p>

There is a fearful moment of reckoning
before us should it ever
chance that when all our trees
shall have been sacrificed on the
altar of the patron-fiend of news, the newspaper
supply shall suddenly be cut off and
we find ourselves some fine morning minus
our tidbits of shame and failure and disaster,

chase one another along the leaves and down
the stems of the plants. Our picnickers are
venturing forth&nbsp;<img src='images/i_024a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /> The wet blades of grass
sparkle in the sunlight. Over on the bank a
ruby-throated hummer is flying back and
forth across a tiny stream that patters and
splashes against a rock. These morsels of
birds love a shower-bath and this fellow
now has one exactly to his mind.
The clouds have drifted down the

glad and grateful for
“the useful trouble
of the rain.”</p>

Once upon a time man conceived
the belief that this universe,
with its many worlds
swinging through space, was
created for him. He fancied
that the sun shone by day to
warm and vivify him; that the stars of night
were none other than lamps to his feet; that
the other animals existed to afford him food
and clothing—and sport; that the very flowers
of the field blossomed and fruited and
were beautiful for his gratification. In fact,
man conceived the belief that instead of being
the wise brother and helper of this creation
amidst which he moves, he was the great central
pivot upon which all revolves&nbsp;<img src='images/i_025a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>A sorry lesson, surely, for man to read into
the broad, open page of Nature’s great book.
Small wonder that to him in his meanness
its message came as “the painful riddle of
the earth.” But it was the best he could do:
it is the best any of us can do until we have
learned the great lesson which the ancient
Wise One has written out for us—which she
will teach us, in time, through death, if we
will not let her teach it through life: the lesson
that use is not appropriation; that appropriation
sets use to groan and sweat under
fardels of evil&nbsp;<img src='images/i_025b.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>We are learning this lesson, with a bad grace,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>like blundering school boys, fumbling at our
hornbook, stuttering and stammering over
the alphabet of life, the while our minds wander
stupidly off to the playthings of our unholy
civilization. Perhaps some day we shall
spell out something of this riddle which we
have made so painful, and with the lesson
get somewhat of the humility that comes
with knowing&nbsp;<img src='images/i_026a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>But now man does not read the book of Nature
to much better purpose than he reads
those other volumes, written by himself, and
bought by himself, in bulk, to adorn his
libraries: portly tomes to which he may point
with pride as evidence that at least his shelves
hold wisdom, tho’ his head may never.</p>

I use no figure of speech when I
say that we may now buy our books
in bulk. I saw, only this morning,
the advertisement of a large dry
goods “emporium” (’tis laces and literature
now) wherein is announced for sale the bound
volumes of a popular magazine. “Over eight
pounds of the choicest reading, bound in the
usual style—olive green.”&nbsp;<img src='images/i_026b.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>Nature has olive greens, too, in styles usual
and unusual, and she has marvelous messages
for her lovers, but she cannot be bought in
bulk, nor put upon shelves, nor even carried
in the head until she first be received into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>heart&nbsp;<img src='images/i_027a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /> A little flaxen haired girl brought
me, this morning, a pure white buttercup on
the stem with three yellow ones.</p>

<p class='c000'>“See,” she said, “Here is one buttercup they
forgot to paint.”&nbsp;<img src='images/i_027b.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>I took the flower from her hand. I could not
tell her just how it happened that this one
perianth was white, but I explained to her
something of how the others came to be
yellow&nbsp;<img src='images/i_027c.jpg' alt='' class='img' /> What we call a flower is not, usually,
the flower at all, but merely its petals. The
real flower is the cluster, in the center of the
calyx, of pistils and their surrounding pollen-bearing
stamens. Away back in the ages when
man had not yet developed his æsthetic sense,
perhaps even before he had learned to make
fire, the primitive flower bore only these pistils
and stamens, with a little outer protective
whorl of green petals. It was fertilized by
the pollen falling upon the pistils.</p>

<div class='section'>

</div>

<div class='c006'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_027.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
But this was not good for the plant.
Those flowers that in some way became
fertilized by pollen from other
plants of the same variety, by cross-fertilization,
in fact, were healthier and stronger
than those fertilized by their own pollen.
In such plants as wind-blown pollen reached
this cross-fertilization was an easy matter,
but the buttercup is not one of these. It is
forced to rely upon insects for fertilization.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>So the plant began to secrete a sweet drop at
the base of each green petal. Such insects as
discovered this nectar and stopped to sip
were dusted with the pollen of the plant and
carried it to other flowers, where it fertilized
the pistils, the insect gathering from every
blossom a fresh burden of pollen to be carried
along on his nectar-seeking round. This
was very good, so far as it went, but the flowers
were pale and inconspicuous, and many
of them, overlooked by the insects, were
never visited. Certain ones, however, owing
to accidents or conditions of soil and moisture,
had the calyx a little larger, or brighter
colored than their fellows, and these the insects
found. It happened, therefore, if anything
ever does merely happen, that the flowers
with bright petals were fertilized, and
their descendants were even brighter colored.
Thus, in time, the buttercup, by the process
which, for lack of a better name, we call natural
selection, came to have bright yellow
petals, because these attract the insect best
adapted to fertilize it&nbsp;<img src='images/i_028a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /> If man’s æsthetic
sense is gratified by the flower’s beauty, why
man is by so much the better off, but that
man is pleased by the bright color is not half
so important to the buttercup as is the pleasure
of a certain little winged beetle which
sees the shining golden cup and knows that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>it means honey&nbsp;<img src='images/i_029a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /> In the same way the lupin,
yonder, with its pretty blue and white blossoms,
has developed its blue petals because
it is fertilized by the bees. They seek it as
they do other blossoms, not only for honey,
but for the pollen itself, which stands them
in place of bread&nbsp;<img src='images/i_029b.jpg' alt='' class='img' /> The very shape of the
flower is due to the visits of countless generations
of this insect. The bee is the insect
best adapted to fertilize the lupin, and when
he alights upon the threshold of a blossom
his weight draws the lower petal down, and
entering to suck the sweets he gets his head
dusted with pollen. If a fly were to gain
entrance to the flower, he would carry away no
pollen. He is smaller than the bee, and his
head could not reach it. So honey-seeking
flies alight in vain; their weight is not enough
to press the calyx open, so they may not enter
and drink of its sweets. Yonder on a blossom
of the mimulus, the odd-looking monkey-plant,
a honeybee just had this same experience.
The bumblebee is the only insect that
is large enough to reach the pollen in this
blossom, and so its doors will open only to
him. Botanists tell us that all this great family,
to which belong the various peas blossoms
and their cousins, were once five-petaled
plants, but natural selection has brought about
their present shape, which is an admirable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>protection against the depredations of small
insects that could only rob but could not fertilize
the flowers&nbsp;<img src='images/i_030a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<div  class='figright id005'>
<img src='images/i_029-w.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Blue is the favorite color of the honeybee,
and next to blue he prefers red. So bee blossoms
are blue or red.</p>

Most of our small white flowers
are fertilized by insects that fly at
night. This is the reason why white
blossoms are more fragrant than
their bright-hued sisters. Bright colors could
not be seen at night, but the fragrance of the
white flowers, always more noticeable by
night than by day, serves the same end—to
attract the useful insects. This is an essential
part of Nature’s wonderful plan. The flower
lives by giving&nbsp;<img src='images/i_030b.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>There is an endless fascination in this page
which Nature opens out before us, in her upland
pastures. A wise teacher once told me
his experience with a restless, unmanageable
boy&nbsp;<img src='images/i_030c.jpg' alt='' class='img' /> “I could do nothing with him,” the
teacher said, “until I got him interested in
field life.” One day this boy went off on a holiday
tramp, returning the day following. His
teacher asked him what he had seen, and
this is what he remembered of his outing:
“I camped in a field for the night,” said he,
“and I saw a bee light on a poppy and crawl
in. The poppy shut up and caught him. Next
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>morning I woke up early and watched, and
by and by the poppy opened and the bee
came out.”&nbsp;<img src='images/i_031a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /> There are those who might
have missed the sacred significance of such a
narrative, but that teacher was a very wise
man and he knew that the reading lesson
given him then was a page from his rough
boy’s soul-life, and he conned it with reverent
delight. Life together was more real for them
both after that day.</p>

The keener our realization of the
human love that is in the flowers,
in the trees, in all the wild life about
us, the richer is our humanity, the
fuller our reception of life and love, the more
thoughtful our use of all the things of Nature
becomes&nbsp;<img src='images/i_031b.jpg' alt='' class='img' /> Once I saw an oriole weaving
some bits of string into his nest. He hung
head downwards, by one string, from a projecting
branch, and worked, for nearly an
hour, with beak and claws. Then he flew
away, triumphant. Later I saw his nest and
understood his action. He tied two pieces of
string together in a very respectable sort of
knot: had wound the long cord thus obtained
in and out among the meshes of his nest and
then, giving it a half-hitch about a twig, had
brought the free end up and tied it securely
to another small branch&nbsp;<img src='images/i_031c.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>I felt grateful for what that bird had accomplished.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>All human achievements seemed to
me worthier after seeing him do this thing.
Nature teaches us so much if we will but
keep still long enough to let her: if we will
only empty ourselves of conceit and knowingness,
and get rid of the notion that all things,
Nature included, are made for us. We are
not the lords of creation. We are only
a small part, albeit the highest
part, of it all, and the better
we learn this lesson the
better men and women
we shall become.</p>

I was sitting here beside the
stream, watching the bees swarm
in and out at the entrance to their
hive, when Hercules passed by.
“Come and watch the bees,” I
called as he passed. “They are
interesting.”&nbsp;<img src='images/i_033a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>He stood and studied the busy
workers, intent upon the business
of their miniature society&nbsp;<img src='images/i_033b.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>“I wonder,” he said at last, “if
our human reason shall ever evolve
a system half so perfect as
the one that mere instinct has
taught these feeble insects.” As I
was silent he continued:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, at all events, I can learn
one lesson from the bees, and be
about my business. If society is
ever to be freed from its burdens
every soul must do its full duty.
One life wasted means a whole
world hindered just that much.”
And Hercules was gone to his
labors&nbsp;<img src='images/i_033c.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>How fearful we all are of wasting
our lives, yet so rarely fearful for
the results of the ceaseless activity
with which we crowd them&nbsp;<img src='images/i_033d.jpg' alt='' class='img' />
But Hercules’ words are full of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>suggestiveness. Is our boasted human reason
really less adequate to the needs of our life
than is what we call the instinct, this thing
that looks so much more reasonable than our
reason, of the lower orders? What if, after
all, we are making a desperate mistake in
supposing that it is this faculty which we
call reason that distinguishes us from the
brute creation?</p>

It is because the bees and the other
dumb creatures have nothing more than
this measure of reason which we call
instinct, that it serves them perfectly.
Man has something else, that draws
him higher; that prompts him further.
But alas for us! With the destiny to live perfectly
as human beings, we yet long for the
restrictions through which we may live perfectly
as the beasts. We seek our lessons
from the brutes while the Eternal waits to
teach us. We cannot live like the beasts. The
divine human spark within us will not let us.
We must live higher than they or we shall
live lower, for our perfection of order is infinitely
higher than theirs, and our failure immeasurably
lower than they can sink&nbsp;<img src='images/i_034a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>But we go on, we modern Athenians, seeking
to ameliorate the conditions we have brought

Hercules is a Socialist. He
always spells society with a
great S, and he declares
in the present state of
Society we can take no thought
for individuals&nbsp;<img src='images/i_035c.jpg' alt='' class='img' /> “The individual
may perish,” he says, in moments of eloquence,
“but the integrity of Society must be
jealously maintained.”&nbsp;<img src='images/i_035d.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>I wonder, as I sit here watching the bees,
whether Society might not, after all, find
easement from its ails if each individual of us,
myself and Hercules included, should pay
strict attention to our individual business of
growing, or becoming humanized?&nbsp;<img src='images/i_035e.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>Just here at my hand a bee has alighted and
is burying its nose in a clover blossom. Here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>is an example of a life that is lived only for
Society, yet so important is the individual in
the opinion of this highly perfected body social,
that I have seen half a dozen bees, when
a laden worker has arrived at the hive opening,
weighted down, too exhausted to do
other than drop, helpless, upon the threshold,
rush to its assistance, relieve it of its heavy
load and help it to pass within to gather
strength for further effort. The strict individualist
complains, in turn, of the bees because
they have no individual life; no existence
separate from the hive. This is true, but
what higher individuality can any creature
desire than is comprised and summed up in
the divine opportunity to bring his individual
gift to the common store?</p>

I have picked the clover blossom
that the bee just left. Beside it are
growing other blossoms, and I gather
a couple. They are the veriest
wayside weeds—dandelion and dog-fennel—but
they are important because they are typical
representatives of the largest order in
the floral kingdom; an order which, although
it was the last to appear in the vegetable
world, has outstripped every other and leads
them all today. Botanists call it the Composite
Order. Its members are really floral socialists,
just as Hercules and the rest of us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>who believe that government is an order of
nature, and good for the race, are human socialists,
whether we know it or not.</p>

But most of us hold a mistaken idea
about the relation of the individual
to the whole. We are apt to theorize
that it is the duty of the individual
to keep the whole in order, and a good many
of us are fully convinced that the world
owes us a living. So it does, and it behooves
each one of us to be faithful in discharging
his individual share of the aggregate debt&nbsp;<img src='images/i_037a.jpg' alt='' class='img' />
Nature has a whole page about that in her
wonderful volume&nbsp;<img src='images/i_037b.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>Take, for instance, this clover. What we call
the blossom is, in reality, many blossoms&nbsp;<img src='images/i_037c.jpg' alt='' class='img' />
Look at the mass under a glass. You will see
that the clover head is made up of numerous
minute cups in a compact cluster. Each cup
is a perfect blossom. As we now see it in the
clover it is a tiny tube, but it once possessed
five slender petals which are now united&nbsp;<img src='images/i_037d.jpg' alt='' class='img' />
The little pointed scollops that rim the cup
suggest these petals. Now, the tiny cup is
descended from a five-petaled ancestor, growing
upon its individual stem and depending
upon insects for its fertilization. The flower
was small, however, and many of them must
have been overlooked by the insects&nbsp;<img src='images/i_037e.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>But those blossoms that, growing very close
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>together, formed little clusters, were more
conspicuous than the solitary ones, and were
discovered, visited for their honey and incidentally
fertilized by the winged freebooters.
These blossoms bore fruit and their descendants
inherited the social instinct prompting
them to draw together that each might give
the other its help and co-operation in attracting
the insects. So, by degrees, the co-operative
habit became fixed in the clover, and in
many other plants, until the compositæ became
a botanical fact. In other words, the individuals
formed a body social of their own,
growing from a compact cluster from a common
stem, each giving and receiving, constantly,
its use and share in the common life.
The many-petaled flowers found it inconvenient
to arrange themselves in the composite
order, and so, as we see in the clover, the
petals have pressed closely together and united
to form a tube-shaped flower, and as the
tubular form is best adapted to receive fertilization
by the bee, which insect is the most
useful to the clover blossom, that form has
been perpetuated in this plant.</p>

<div class='section'>

<div class='c006'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_038.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Thus by the simple process of each
individual giving itself to the
common life, the mutual protection and
development of the whole, this order
of plants has become the largest in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>floral kingdom. The compositæ have circled
the globe. They fill our hothouses and flourish
in our gardens; they greet us by the dusty
road, and in the summer woods. The lovely
golden-rod, the sturdy asters, the aristocratic
chrysanthemums, the dainty daisies all belong
to this great order. So does helianthus,
the big, beaming sunflower.</p>

<div class='section'>

</div>

<div class='c006'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_039.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
It is quite true that each blossom of
the compositæ has given its life to
the race. But what if, after all, life
with our fellows is a giving instead
of the receiving we are wont to think it?&nbsp;<img src='images/i_039a.jpg' alt='' class='img' />
What if, after all, the true outlook upon Society
will one day show us that our neighbor
is put here that we may have the great, the
inestimable joy of living for him?&nbsp;<img src='images/i_039b.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>All matter is made up of molecules, Science
tells us, and there is another Voice as of one
having authority, which tells us that One
hath made of one blood all nations of men for
to dwell upon the face of the earth&nbsp;<img src='images/i_039c.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>We humans are but larger molecules in the
body social. We live only in so far as the
common life flows through us. We never
fully, in our plans, and by a wonderful provision
of Divine Wisdom we cannot give one
another that which is really and unmistakably
our own. No human thought, even, ever
traveled a straight course from one human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>soul to another and was received exactly as
it was sent. We live our lives each within the
molecular envelope of his individual body,
and we can no more mix, in reality, than the
molecules mix. We live only in the flux and
reflux of the Life of all, and only as we pass
this on have power to receive.</p>

<div class='section'>

<div class='c006'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_040.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
It is when life is fullest that we turn
to our fellows. Those of us who are
true know that then we need them
most, and so, our real drawings together
are in order that we may give. We
know this in that secret part of us where lies
what most of us call our human weakness,
but we are faithless to the knowledge, and
choose to live on a lower plane, within that
outer circle which we call knowing&nbsp;<img src='images/i_040a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /> We
think we come together to receive, but who
of us does not know the emptiness of death
that lies in such coming? We are all a little
better than this. In secret we know that it is
more blessed to give than receive, but we are
ashamed of the knowledge&nbsp;<img src='images/i_040b.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>We are less simple and true than the dandelion,
the dog-fennel and the sweet-clover here
in the grass. The small common blossoms
grow so cheerily one is glad to come back to
them. It is true that not one wee tube or
strap or head in any cluster could have much
life outside the aggregate blossom, but the integrity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>and perfection of each is an essential
factor in the integrity and perfection of the
whole. The tiny single flower that I can pull
from this dandelion seems but an insignificant
speck, but, by and by, could it have
been let alone, it would, its ripeness and perfection
attained, have taken to itself wings
and sailed fluffily off upon the breeze to renew
its life perhaps a thousand miles from
here. Seeing it float through the air a poet
might have found it a theme for a sonnet. A
scientist might have seen universal law embodied
in its structure, or a seer have reasoned
from it to life eternal.</p>

Yet, but for the co-operation of its
fellows in the body floral, it could
not have lived any more than, save
for its fellows, what we know as
the dandelion could have lived. The law of
co-operation, like all of Nature’s laws, makes
for rightness and fitness all along the line&nbsp;<img src='images/i_041a.jpg' alt='' class='img' />
She teaches us, with ever-repeated emphasis,
the lesson of independence of kind. The isolated
being is, everywhere, the comparatively
helpless being. The tree growing by itself in
the open field often attains to more symmetrical
perfection and beauty than the tree in the
crowded forest, but woodmen tell us that the
forest tree makes better timber&nbsp;<img src='images/i_041b.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>We must live with and for our fellows, but he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>does this best who, in the quiet order of the
common life, opens widest his soul to the
Source thereof, and growing to the full
stature of a man helps on to perfection
what should be that

The little spring here gushes
up and then sweeps
away along a stony bed
overgrown with brakes and
tares. On its margin, amid
a tangle of wild blackberry,
I have come upon a forest
of scouring-rush&nbsp;<img src='images/i_043a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>It is a quaint growth. I love
to put my face close to the
earth and, looking through
the rushes’ green stems, to
fancy myself a wee brownie,
wandering among a&nbsp;<img src='images/i_043b.jpg' alt='' class='img' />
dense wilderness of pines.
The development of the
miniature trees is an interesting
process&nbsp;<img src='images/i_043c.jpg' alt='' class='img' /> First the
ground is covered with
slender brown fingers&nbsp;<img src='images/i_043d.jpg' alt='' class='img' />
thrusting up through the
soil. These grow rapidly,
and in a few days spread
out their brief, verticillate
branches to the breeze, as
proudly as any great tree
might do. Here is a tiny finger
just pointing upward;
yonder towers the giant
of the lilliputian forest, fully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>half-a-foot high. “Scouring-weed,” says
the farmer, contemptuously, “they aint no
good. Some call ’em horsetail.”</p>

<div class='section'>

</div>

<div class='c006'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_044.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
In fact, the queer, witchy little things
have a number of names: candle-rush,
scouring-rush, horsetail, and their own
proper appellation, equisetum. I have
gathered a number of the little trees
and they lie side by side in my palm
while my mind tries to recall a few of the
facts that go to make up the plant’s wonderful
history. Our grandmothers used to strew their
floors with it, that no careless tread might
soil the snowy boards. They used it, as well,
for scouring, hence its name. Those who seek
correspondences between the natural and
physical kingdoms find the rush an emblem
of cleansing, and this is precisely the office
which, since earliest creation, it has filled for
the world. For our scouring-rush was not always
the puny, insignificant thing we see it.
It belongs to the carboniferous age. It has
nothing to do with our modern civilization. It
had reached its highest perfection and entered
upon its downward career before man appeared
on the earth. Its progenitors flourished
with the giant ferns, the great, rank mosses,
and all the rest of the carbon-storing vegetation.
A mighty tree was our little rush in
those days, growing several hundred feet tall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>and spreading out its huge whorls of branches
in every direction. So we find it today, in the
anthracite beds of the eastern slope. What
happened to it that we should know it, living,
as this degenerate creature of the bog?</p>

<div class='section'>

</div>

<div class='c006'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_045.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
In the carboniferous age the air surrounding
the earth was much warmer
than at present, warmer than we
find it in the tropics. The great mass
which constitutes this globe was not yet cool
enough to support any very high forms of life.
There were no trees, as we now understand
the word, and there was very little animal
life. Beetles crawled about, spiders and scorpions,
and salamanders big as alligators, but
there were no mammals, no birds&nbsp;<img src='images/i_045a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /> The
world was in twilight, reeking with moisture,
steaming in the warm air which it filled
with all sorts of noxious gases. It rained aquafortis
and brimstone, and the sweating earth
sent these up again in deadly fog-banks of
poisonous vapor&nbsp;<img src='images/i_045b.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<div  class='figright id005'>
<img src='images/i_045-w.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>These were the conditions that our big rush
loved. Its huge spongy stem and branches
drank in life from the death-laden atmosphere.
Its great creeping rootstocks soaked it up from
the morass beneath and the rush grew luxuriantly.
Its office was indeed a cleansing one,
to purify the atmosphere and make it fit to
sustain animal life. In time, as the huge primeval
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>trees reached maturity, they died, and
the mighty stems fell back in the bog. Then
came some great upheaval, some cataclysm
of nature such as we find everywhere recorded
in her rocky books. The land rose or sank,
and the rocks and debris of the sea floor were
thrown upon the decaying vegetation. It was
pressed and compressed beneath this weight.
The fronds of the huge ferns; the tall stems
of the giant rushes; the monstrous club-mosses,
and the primeval forest became a peat-bog.
Still greater pressure—a longer lapse of
aeons, and the peat became coal.</p>

We burn them now, in our grates,
the progenitors of these feeble
things lying here, limply, in my
palm. Is it not, as I said, a wonderful
history the frail thing has. A degenerate
stock, botanists call it. So are its cousins
the ferns degenerate, with no botanical Nordau
to sound warning against them. But degenerates
tho’ they all are, they have still the
spirit of the pioneer. They dwell in the outposts
of vegetable civilization. We do not find
them flourishing where Nature is in her gentlest
moods&nbsp;<img src='images/i_046a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /> Once, down in the crater of
an active volcano, half-a-mile from any soil,
growing from a sulphur-stained black-lava
floor, I found a clump of waving green ferns,
as high as my head, spreading out their broad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>fronds as though to cover and hide the terrible
nakedness of the unfinished earth. A thousand
years from now a grain-field may spread
where now those frail green plumes have just
begun their gracious work.</p>

<div class='section'>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
This clothing of the earth and the
cleansing of the air are the tasks the
giant rushes helped to perform for
the young world. During the process
the rank gases of the atmosphere were
gradually stored up within their great stems.
Liberated, now, in our grates and retorts they
give us heat and light. Then, the atmosphere
becoming purer, the earth cooled and life sustaining,
new growths appeared. All the conditions
were improved, but the improvement
meant death to the big rush. It was starving.
It could not find food in the thin air. Its roots
could not suck up enough moisture to sustain
life. It became smaller and smaller. Flowers
and seeds it had never borne. It now gave up
its leaves. Between every two whorls of
branches on the scouring-rush we find a little
brown, toothed sheath encircling the stem.
In the days of the plants’ prosperity each of
these teeth was a leaf, but now the rush can
maintain no such extravagance as leaves, so
there remain only these poor survivals. The
stem is hollow, and is divided, between the
whorls of branches, into closed sections, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>joints. It has also an outer ring of hollow
tubes, through which moisture is drawn up
from the soil, to feed the branches. The rush
is a little higher order of creation than the
fern, but it is a cryptogram; that is, a plant
never bearing true seeds, but propagating by
spores&nbsp;<img src='images/i_048a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>And so, fallen upon hard lines, chilled, stunted
by the cold, but having a brief span of life
when the spring rains have made the
earth wet and warm, and before
the summer heat has come
to wither it, we have our
scouring-rush only
a few inches
high.</p>

And this branched stem which we
see is not fertile. ’Tis enough for
it to support its waving green
feather. The fertile stems are not
branched. They appear above the earth, pale
and shrinking; put forth no branches, but live
a brief season, develop their spores and disappear&nbsp;<img src='images/i_049a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>The growth of the scouring-rush seems to me
to show something beautiful, as well as interesting. There
is a certain light-hearted gaiety
in the waving, tree-like thing which makes
one forget that it is a degenerate stock, and
doomed to destruction. Still a little work remains
for it to do: still some waste places and
miasmatic bogs to be cleansed and purified,
and so the little rush grows on, the merest
shadow of its once opulent self. I am sure that
the last horsetail to be seen on earth will grow
just as breezily, as greenly and as cheerily as
any now waving in this make-believe enchanted
forest at my feet&nbsp;<img src='images/i_049b.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>And who knows what may be the fate of that
which was the real life of that ancient plant—the
forces of light and heat set free in our
furnaces and forges, to begin, again, their office
of ministering use?&nbsp;<img src='images/i_049c.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>Did the giant rush die? Does anything die?
Ages have seen the rushes fall and pass from
sight, to wake to glorious light in the leaping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>flames. We see leaves fall each year and turn
to mold from which other life-forms spring.
There will be other poppies, next year, where
yonder orange-red blossoms nod in the breeze.
The waving grain, already headed out and
bowing under its burden of raindrops, was but
a few months since a mere handful of dry kernels.
They were cast upon the ground, and
they died, if that tossing sea of green is death.
We see these things recurring upon every
side of us, yet we still go up and down the
earth demanding of prophet, priest and poet:
“If a man die shall he live again?”&nbsp;<img src='images/i_050a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>A far cry from the little sprigs of scouring-rush
in my hand? But Life is a far cry,
from Everlasting through Eternity,
and who shall say, of the
least of these, its manifestations,
“It is

Down among the watercresses,
an hour ago, studying
the movements of a
mammoth slug, I was startled
by a shadow that fell
directly across my hands.
At the same moment there
was an excited flurry and
scurrying to shelter, among a tuneful mob of
song-sparrows who, all unmindful of my presence,
were teetering close beside me upon the
tall mustard stalks that swayed beneath their
weight&nbsp;<img src='images/i_051a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>Looking upward I saw, between me and the
sun, a pigeon-hawk soaring on motionless
wings in the freedom of the upper air. I
watched him with a joy that had no touch of
envy, as he circled widely against the sky,
rising, falling, swerving, returning, with scarcely
a dip of the strong, outstretched wings&nbsp;<img src='images/i_051b.jpg' alt='' class='img' />
High though he poised, my thought could reach
him; strong though his flight, my fancy could
follow and outstrip him. He, high above the
mountain-tops, gazed downward to the earth.
His thoughts, his desires were here. To materialize
them he mounted the air. With my feet
upon the earth; with no palpable pinions
wherewith to climb the ether, yet have I moments

Something of this&nbsp;<img src='images/i_052a.jpg' alt='' class='img' />
passed through my brain
as I watched the circling
hawk. Once, with a flash
of his strong wings, he
made a downward turn
and, swift and still, he
dropped earthward&nbsp;<img src='images/i_052b.jpg' alt='' class='img' />
Then, as if frustrated in whatever had been
his design, he wheeled again and climbed as
swiftly up the air&nbsp;<img src='images/i_052c.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>I like that phrase as describing the flight of a
bird. It is so literally what the creature does.
A bird is not superior to gravitation. But for
that force he would be the helpless victim of
every little breeze, like a balloon, which is unable
to shape a course or do anything but float
helplessly before the wind. The balloon floats
because it is lighter than the air, but the air
which the bird displaces is lighter than he,
and he only moves in it by virtue of his ability
to extract from it, by the motion of his wings,
sufficient recoil to propel himself forward.
He rises, as do we humans, by means of that
which resists him&nbsp;<img src='images/i_052d.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>I love to watch the seagulls. They do this so
perfectly, and seem to delight to give us lessons
in ærial navigation as they dip and whirl
and call about the steamers, on the Bay.
Their wings are so easy to study while in action.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>The first joint, to where the wing bends
back and outward, is strong and compact, cup
shaped underneath. The second joint tapers.
The feathers are long and do not overlap so
closely as do those of the first joint, and at the
free end they spread out and turn upward.
The upper surface of the wing is convex, the
lower surface concave. In flying the wings are
thrown forward and downward. Flying is not
a flapping of the wings up and down, and if a
bird were to strike its wings backward and
downward, as its manner of flight is so often
pictured, it would turn a forward somersault
in the air.</p>

<div class='section'>

</div>

<div class='c006'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_053.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Structurally the wing of a
bird is a screw. It twists in opposite
directions during the up and
down strokes, and describes a figure
of 8 in the air. The bird throws its wings
forward and downward. The air is forced
back and compressed in the cup-shaped hollows
of the wings, and these latter, by the recoil
thus obtained, drag the body forward&nbsp;<img src='images/i_053a.jpg' alt='' class='img' />
This resistance of the air is absolutely essential
to flight. We who think that, but for the
buffetings of hard fate, we, too, might soar
high and fly free in the upper realm of endeavor,
should watch the efforts of the birds in a
calm. We shall scarcely see them flying. If
impelled to flight, by necessity, the process is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>a most laborious one. There being no resisting
wind on which to climb (birds always fly
against the wind) the climber must, by the
rapid action of his wings, establish a recoil
that will send him along. Watch the little
mud-hen, flying close to the surface of the water,
ready to dive the instant its timidity takes
fright. Its wings vibrate swiftly, unceasingly,
for it rarely rises high enough above the water
to have advantage of the air currents. For it
there are no long, soaring sweeps through the
air; no freedom from the labors of its cautious
flight. It is a very spendthrift of effort because
of the timidity that never lets it rise to the
sustaining forces just above its head. To climb
the sky is not for him who hugs cover.</p>

To fly! The very thought sets
the nerves atingle. It is joy to be
afloat, “with a wet sheet
and a flowing sea and a wind
that follows fast.” It is a joy
to be on the back of a swiftly
running horse, with the wind rushing away
from your face as you ride, bearing every
care from your brain&nbsp;<img src='images/i_054a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /> But to traverse
the air—to fly! This joy we long for: we
have an indisputable, an inalienable right to
long for it. To what heights may we rise?
This, after all, is the question that concerns
us. Sordid, creeping wights that we are, constantly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>referring our heavenward aspiration
to the desire of the mortal, we still</p>

Our very protests, our kicking
against the pricks that would incite
us to higher effort are but our blind
fear lest, after all, they should not
mean flight. We are afraid of our moments of
faith; ashamed of our aspiring impulse, the
upward impulse that throbbed through all life
since the world was born. We send forward
our souls if haply they should find God, while
we remain behind to weigh and test their evidence
when they return to us—if they ever
do, hugging the surface the while, lest a sustaining
breath of spiritual force lift us clean
above the safe shelter in which we may dive
altogether should our returning souls bring
back news of the meanings of life, scaring us
to cover, after all, by the thought that we
ourselves, are heaven and hell&nbsp;<img src='images/i_055a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>Usually we are content to grovel. We traverse
our little round and declare it to be destiny.
We prate of the limitations of our humanity,
forgetful of that humanity’s limitless capacity
to receive. With insincere self-abasement
we declare ourselves to be worms of the dust,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>and the spirits of light who look upon us may
readily believe our assertions&nbsp;<img src='images/i_056a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>But there are moments when the scales fall
from our eyes. We get fleeting glimpses, then,
of the meaning and the end of our human nature.
We know that it is in the skies. We
know that we have ourselves fashioned the
chain that binds us to earth. We know that
we were made for flight, and we know that
we know all this. Still afar in the sky
the hawk soars, with downward gaze
seeking his desire. Still, tho’ my feet
are upon the earth, my spirit
fares upward in its flight toward
its desire, above and
beyond its strong
wings’ farthest
flight.</p>

I wonder whether the restless
impulse that sends city folks hill-ward
in the springtime is not a
part of the Divine Plan that
would lead us all to lift up our
eyes to the hills whence our help
cometh. They flock up here, the
city folks, during these first spring
days, to eat their luncheons by
the roadside and to fill their hands
with the poppies and wild hyacinth,
the blue-eyed grass and
pimpernel that everywhere dot
the young meadows’ glowing
green. I hear, at night-fall, mother’s
voices calling the little ones
to prepare for home-going, and I
love to see the contented parties
go wandering down, the tiniest
tired climber usually sound asleep
in his father’s arms with the sun’s
last rays caressing the small face.
It is good for them to be here.
There is, in the dumbest of us, a
faint stirring of recognition that
the hope and promise of life are
in the young year. This love of
the childhood of things is the best
thing our human nature knows:
the best because there is in it the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>least of self. It is a different thing from the
love of new beginnings. It is not new beginnings,
but first principles that the soul seeks,
now, and so we climb the hills, as naturally as
the daisies look upward, leaving behind us the
pitiful aims that end in self and belong to the
dead level.</p>

In the springtime love awakens, born
anew in the green wonder of the season’s
childhood. Yonder where the road
climbs the hill the sunlight is sifting in
long bars through the eucalyptus trees,
making a brown and golden ladder all
along the way. In everything is the fresh,
tender suggestion of a Sunday afternoon in
the springtime. The air is full of the scent of
swamp-willow and laurel, and the breath of
feeding cattle on the hills&nbsp;<img src='images/i_058a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>By the roadside He and She walk shyly apart.
They could scarcely clasp hands across the
space that separates them, yet one seeing
them knows their hearts are close together.
The blue sky arches over them: the soft
clouds pass lightly above their heads: the
sunbeams bring brighter rounds for the brown
and golden ladder his feet and hers tread lightly.
They are palpably “of the people.” Her
hands are roughened and red from toil. His
shoulders are bent by the early bearings of
heavy burdens. Neither He nor She is over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>twenty years old, and they are poor, as some
count riches, but to them, together, has come
the sweetness of life, and He and She are
walking on the heights&nbsp;<img src='images/i_059a.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

Yesterday they were but a boy
and a girl, but today He to her is
Manhood; She, to him, is Womanhood,
and in this great human wilderness
they have reached out and found each
other. Could anything be more wonderful than
this? Could anything exceed in beauty this secret
of theirs that he who runs may read in
every line of their illumined faces?&nbsp;<img src='images/i_059b.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>Students versed in the ’ologies: sociologists,
philanthropists, economists and progressionists
of every sort, we know all that you would
say. We have heard your arguments time and
again. We have listened to your statistics and
watched the shaking of your head over these
unions of the poor. But the wisdom of life is
wiser than men, else He and She would do
well to listen to you instead of walking together
here on the hill road. They do not know
these things that we are seeking to reduce to
what we call social science; and if they should
know them, what then? Are they not of more
value than many sparrows?&nbsp;<img src='images/i_059c.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>The afternoon shadows lengthen. Home-going
groups are beginning the long descent. The
voices of little children calling to one another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>silverly over the hillside. He and She are
not hastening. They have loitered along to
where a bend in the road affords a wide outlook
upon the city below, the gleaming bay,
the white-winged ships coming in through the
Golden Gate, the distant hills. In her hand are
some poppies which he gathered.</p>

Down to the western horizon
sinks the sun. The gold has
faded from the road, leaving it
a winding ribbon of grey. The
crests of the hills and the gently
swelling uplands are flooded
with crimson light. It touches the eucalyptus
trees into glory and flames in splendor along
the western sky. It lights her face and his as
they stand transformed before each other.
They do not know that the crimson light has
made them beautiful. They think the beauty
each sees is the other’s, a part of their wonderful
discovery, and who shall say that either
is wrong? It is we who are blind, and not
love. Indeed, love, alone, sees clearly. External,
temporal conditions have made his body
less than noble; have crossed his face with
dull, heavy lines. They have narrowed her
mental horizon and imprisoned her soul in a
poor little cage, but He and She are held above
these, now. They have been touched by the
finger of God, and have seen each other’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>beauty, the beauty that is their human right;
that once seen is never, again, wholly lost.</p>

wonderful green—the green
has turned to&nbsp;<img src='images/i_061b.jpg' alt='' class='img' />
white. The early moon
has come out to light
the hill. Hand in hand
they are passing down
the road. Hand in hand
they are going through life, toiling together,
bearing together the burdens Fate brings to
them. They know not what these may be. It
is not given them to know the future, or by
taking thought to lighten its ills or explain the
blunders that have heaped these up. They
have no strength or power, but to them has
been given love&nbsp;<img src='images/i_061c.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>Will love be theirs when Spring is gone and
the summer drouth is upon them; when Autumn’s
harvest time is passed them by and
Winter’s breath has chilled their blood? Will
love be theirs when, hand in hand, in the uncertain
white light, they journey down the hill
of life?&nbsp;<img src='images/i_061d.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>The cynic smiles at the question. The scientist
deprecates it. Philanthropist and sociologist
shake their heads&nbsp;<img src='images/i_061e.jpg' alt='' class='img' /></p>

<p class='c000'>Let it pass. Love is theirs now. The universe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>is theirs, for each to each is universal. The
Life of the universe is in them, and in
the shimmering radiance that lights
the way, silvering the city and
making long, shining paths
across the distant water
as they go walking
down the
hill road.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
